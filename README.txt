-- Description --

The Hangman program is a java program that runs a Hangman game. It is a simple implementation of the famous word game. All it requires is java to run the program or an IDE of your choice.

-- Instructions --
Once you have run the program a GUI will appear where you can play the game. You have a few options to pick from, but to start the game click the "Start Game" button to begin. 
The "Start Game" button is also used as a reset button if you wanna retry at any point. There is also a textbar where you can enter your letter gusses to try and figure out some of the word before guessing. 
Once you have entered a letter click "Enter" and the game will inform you if your guess is correct or incorrect. 
If your guess is incorrect the game will display the first part of the hangman indicating your guess was wrong. You then repeat this process entering your letter each time and using "Enter". 
Be careful however as you only have 6 attempts before the hangman is complete and you lose! 
If you correctly guess the word before 6 attempts and you wish to play again you must use the "Start Game" button to begin again. Same goes with if you lose the game and wish to play again. 

The answer will be displayed in the command line if you get stuck. 

All files needed to run this program correctely will be included in the zip file. The other option is to download every file separate.
